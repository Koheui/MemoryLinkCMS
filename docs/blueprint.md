## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep indigo (#4B0082), evocative of remembrance, to honor the memories being captured. This rich, dark hue conveys respect and provides a sophisticated feel.
- Background color: Very light lavender (#F0E6FF), a desaturated variant of indigo, to maintain the memorial feel without overwhelming the interface.
- Accent color: Muted plum (#8E44AD), an analogous color that will complement the primary indigo and add subtle visual interest without drawing too much attention.
- Body font: 'Literata' serif for readable longer text content.
- Headline font: 'Poppins' sans-serif, for a modern, geometric touch to titles and callouts.
- Use simple, clean icons, such as the Remix Icon set.
- Design the layout with a focus on mobile-first responsiveness, ensuring content is easily accessible and readable on smaller screens.
